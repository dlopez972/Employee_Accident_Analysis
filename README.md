# Employee Accident Analysis

Workplace accidents are an unfortunate reality for a lot of organizations, but hopefully we can start to understand them better in order to reduce the number of accidents in the future. Typically an organization has a team that's responsible for safety, who will be responsible for the collection and storage of this type of data. We can try to take this accident data and combine it with some of our typical HR data in order to better understand these workplace accidents.
